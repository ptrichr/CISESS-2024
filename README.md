> Authored by Nathan Ho, mentored by Dr. Hu Yang.

This repository contains the RTL control logic for a Digilent Arty S7 FPGA board, which implements the signal processing suite of a microwave radiometer prototype; as well its associated documentation.

## Cloning

Version control was made possible by the [vivado-git](https://github.com/barbedo/vivado-git) tool. Clone the repository as normal, and then run the TCL script located in the root directory labeled `microwave-radiometer-2024.tcl` to regenerate the auxiliary project files (in Vivado: `Tools -> Run TCL Script`). See the `vivado-git` repository for project structure.
